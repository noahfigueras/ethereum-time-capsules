# Ethereum Time Capsules
This project was made for ideamarket.io hackathon on gitcoin.co. The idea is to build a contract in which the user is able to submit 
a capsule with a message to the ethereum network. In order to submit this capsule to the network, the creator will have to assign 
to it a future date and time when the message will be revealed to the world. 

## Instalation in local machine
* Clone the repo `git clone` and `cd` into directory
* `npm install`
* Start a local network with `truffle develop` or `ganache-cli`
* Start `http-server` inside `/client` directory  

Make sure to use the correct contract abi & address in the client to interact with smart contract.  

## Try the app already deployed in the ropsten network
* Start `http-server` inside `client` directory
* contract-address: `0x49c21F64501ffEF20eEeA30b40387F8A3F81a64C`
* This address is by default already in the client app.
